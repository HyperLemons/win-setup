My recommended programs (organized in folders) and setup for Windows 10

## Step 1: Windows setup
Since i'm still a current user of Windows 10 this is primarily focused on only Windows 10 setup, programs, and possibly tweaks.
If at any time in the future I switch to Windows 11, I will either update sections of this guide to include parts for Windows 11 or create a new guide dedicated to Windows 11.

If you want to go all in, especially for gaming, optimize for latency. A great guide that is constantly being updated (at the time of writing this) is [amitxv's PC-Tuning guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning).
If the guide has too many comprimises (the Physical Setup section is more recommendations than mandatory) than you can do a clean Windows 10 install with a [Windows 10 USB installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) or with [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) using a Windows ISO from - [UUP dump](https://uupdump.net) (Windows 10 1709+)

    (this is a blatant rip from https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning/blob/main/docs/building.md,
    i'm still figuring out Github formatting and will link to that section of his guide if I fix this and decide not to make
    own version of this ISO download tutorial)
    
    - [UUP dump](https://uupdump.net) (Windows 10 1709+)

        - Search for the Windows version you desire and download the latest feature update instance

        - Choose the desired language and click next

        - Uncheck all editions except the professional edition and click next

            <img src="/media/uupdump-choose-edition.png" width="750">

        - Copy the configuration below, ensure that ``Include updates`` is ticked and click ``Create download package``

            <img src="/media/uupdump-download-options.png" width="750">

        - Extract the downloaded package and run ``uup_download_windows.cmd``. The final ISO file will be created in the same directory as the script
