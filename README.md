Setup for Windows 10 (and possibly 11 in the future) and my recommended programs (organized in folders)

# Step 1: Windows setup
Since i'm still a current user of Windows 10 this is primarily focused on only Windows 10 setup, programs, and possibly tweaks. If at any time in the future I switch to Windows 11, I will either update sections of this guide to include parts for Windows 11 or create a new guide dedicated to Windows 11.

If you want to go all in, especially for gaming, optimize for latency. A great guide that is constantly being updated (at the time of writing this) is **[amitxv's PC-Tuning guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning)**.

If the guide has too many comprimises for you (the Physical Setup section is more recommendations than mandatory, but support for various Windows features like UWP may be removed. Some of these features removed can be found [here](https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=does+fedora+support+ntfs&cat=web&pl=opensearch&language=english)) than you can do a clean Windows 10 install with [Microsoft's Windows 10 USB installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) or with [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) using a Windows ISO from [UUP dump](https://uupdump.net) (Windows 10 1709+)

    **(this is a blatant rip from https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning/blob/main/docs/building.md,
    i'm still figuring out Github formatting and will link/give proper credit to that section of his guide if I fix this and
    decide not to make own version of this ISO download tutorial)**

        - Extract the downloaded package and run ``uup_download_windows.cmd``. The final ISO file will be created in the same directory as the script
