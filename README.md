Setup for Windows 10 (and possibly 11 in the future) and my recommended programs (organized in folders)

# Step 1: Installing Windows
Since i'm still a current user of Windows 10 this is primarily focused on only Windows 10 setup, programs, and (possibly) miscellaneous tweaks for the OS and programs. If at any time in the future I switch to Windows 11, I will either update sections of this guide to include parts for Windows 11 or create a new guide dedicated to Windows 11.

If you want to go all in, especially for gaming, optimize for latency. A great guide that is constantly being updated (at the time of writing this) is **[amitxv's PC-Tuning guide](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning)**.

If the guide has too many comprimises for you (the Physical Setup section is more recommendations than mandatory, but support for various Windows features like UWP may be removed. Some of these features removed can be found [here](https://www.startpage.com/sp/search?query=does+fedora+support+ntfs&cat=web&pl=opensearch&language=english)) than you can do a clean Windows 10 install with [Microsoft's Windows 10 USB installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) or with [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) using a Windows ISO from [UUP dump](https://uupdump.net) (Windows 10 1709+)

    **(this is a blatant rip from https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning/blob/main/docs/building.md,
    i'm still figuring out Github formatting and will link/give proper credit to that section of his guide if I fix this and
    decide not to make my own version of this ISO download tutorial)**

        - Search for the Windows version you desire and download the latest feature update instance

        - Choose the desired language and click next

            <img src="/media/uupdump-choose-language.png" width="750">

        - Uncheck all editions except the professional edition and click next

            <img src="/media/uupdump-choose-edition.png" width="750">

        - Copy the configuration below, ensure that ``Include updates`` is ticked and click ``Create download package``

            <img src="/media/uupdump-download-options.png" width="750">

        - Extract the downloaded package and run ``uup_download_windows.cmd``. The final ISO file will be created in the same directory as the script
